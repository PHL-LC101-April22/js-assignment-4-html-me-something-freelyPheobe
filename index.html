      <p>Some of us may struggle with feeling behind but when you take inventory of what you've accomplished and the places you've been, it'll surprise you how far you've come. The idea of going through a camera roll was like an ah-ha moment! Let's take a look at what I've been up to within the past year.</p>

      <p>The photos above were taken July 4th weekend 2021. It is me an my mother attending the wedding of a family friend in Atlanta.  A whopping 3 days of traditional African wedding, English-white dress wedding, and lastly barbecue. We skipped the barbecue and visited a garden instead. Time well spent with my favorite lady and thorn. We understood why it's called Hotlanta. </p>

      <p>Took my first international solo trip. Mexico! This was a major milestone. To say I was nervous was an understatement but I knew it absolutely was necessary to push me out of my comfort zone. Jumped into a cenote (with a life vest), ziplined upside down, made dinner with a Mayan family, went snorkeling. On every excursion I met incredible individuals with amazing stories. My first travel story.</p>
